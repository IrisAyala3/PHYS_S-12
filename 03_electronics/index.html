        <p> This was my first experience w/a bread board. I learned that you can build electronic circuits on a bread board. It works as a patch panel, with rows of holes that allow to connect wires and other components together. Our first task was to light-up an LED, light emitting diode, using our 1000x resistor. Resistors resist the flow of electrical energy in a circuit, changing the voltage and current. The first time I tried this, my resistor and LED were not connected to the rest of the circuit. After looking through a tutorial, I plugged my red wire to 5j and black wire to 10a, use resistor to connect row 5 to row 10, led plugged into 5e and 5f + resistor to 5c and 10c.</p>

        <p> In Lab, we practiced splitting a higher voltage circuit and used our multimeter to measure the voltage. We started by simulating different scenarios in Tinkercad: </p>
